# Emerging-systems

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
//In the 1-4 Assignment: Preparing your TI Board, the goal of the project was setting up the machine along with Code Composer Studio (CCS) so that it can communicate and read the code that will later be developed to program and control the microcontroller. In the 3-2 assignment, I created code to make the lights blink on and off on the microntroller based on the word that was typed in the console Terminal.

2. What did you do particularly well?
// I did a great job with setting up the board and making sure the CCS editor was configured correctly to get an accurate reading of the given functions and operations.

3. Where could you improve?
// In my humble opinion, I think I could improve on all aspects. I would like to be able to develop code to make the board do more things.

4. What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
// I rely heavily on youtube and embedded systems sites on information for adding to my support network.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
//I will use analyzing and following industry standards to create embedded systems. This is something I will use on future proejcts and/or coursework.

6. How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
//The code that was used to develop the project made it readable and adaptpable.
